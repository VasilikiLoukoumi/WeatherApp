# WeatherApp
A java app that retrieves weather related data from the wunderground API and creates a new txt file containing the data.
To run it:

Option a:
Download the jar file.
Open command line and change your directory to the directory you've downloaded the file.
Then type java -jar WeatherApp.jar.

Option b:
Open the WeatherApp file in an editor like Eclipse and run it.

Note: I already have a text file inside this project, you can delete it, but either way it will be replaced by a new file as soon as you run the program.
